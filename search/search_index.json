For each sample, fastq files were aligned per read group and then merged using Picard tools (v2.18.0, http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard ) SortSam command to make an interim bam file. Final, analysis-ready bam file per sample \u2013 tumor and normal bam, if available \u2013 was created by series of steps following best practices guidelines from GATK4 (version 4.0.8.1) (DePristo et al., 2011), namely MarkDuplicates, Indel Realignment, and Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR). Alignment QC metrics were calculated using GATK4 DepthOfCoverage (for WGS) and CollectHSMetrics (for exome) as well as Qualimap (version 2.2.1) (Okonechnikov et al., 2016) bamqc for merged bam files. Coverage statistics were also based on regions of interest (ROIs) which consisted of exonic region-level annotations for biotypes: protein-coding gene, microrna, lincrna, and pseudogene from Ensembl gene annotations for canine genome (v91 and higher). We flagged samples as failed QC if merged bam file has a genome-wide coverage of < 30% or > 75% of ROIs have 30% or lesser coverage. Accordingly, three samples (of three cases) failed QC step and they were removed from all analyses. Note that 77 cases in patient tissues and samples section represent all cases which passed QC at WGS, exome, RNA-seq, and methylation level data preprocessing. RNA alignments \u00b6 Raw fastq files from paired-end RNA-seq assay for 41 tumor samples and 3 matched normal tissue samples were first preprocessed through fastp (version 0.19.5) (Chen et al., 2018) to perform read-based quality pruning, including adapter trimming. Resulting fastq files were then used as input for kallisto quant (version 0.45.0) \u2013 a pseudoalignment based method to quantify RNA abundance at transcript-level in transcripts per million (TPM) counts format. We then used sleuth R package (version 0.30.0) (Pimentel et al., 2017) to output model-based, gene-level normalized TPM matrix which was also corrected for potential batch effects due to RNA-seq data derived from two sequencing core facilities and tissue archival (snap-frozen vs FFPE). Detailed workflow, including command-line parameters for model fitting are under code/rnaseq directory. RRBS alignments \u00b6 Raw fastq files from RRBS assay for 45 tumor samples were processed through FastQC (version 0.11.7, https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc ) and Trim Galore (version 0.5.0, https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore ) for quality control, filtering low quality base calls, and adapter trimming. Trimmed reads were then mapped to a bisulfite converted reference genome (canFam3.1, obtained from Ensembl release 85) using the Bismark Bisulfite Mapper (v0.19.1) with the Bowtie2 short read aligner (v2.2.3) (Krueger and Andrews, 2011), allowing for one non-bisulfite mismatch per read. Cytosine methylation calls were made for the mapped reads using the Bismark methylation extractor (version 0.19). The resulting methylation values were obtained as $\\beta$-values, calculated as the ratio of methylated to total reads at a given CpG site. DNA fingerprinting \u00b6 DNA fingerprinting for each of WGS and exome tumor-normal and tumor-only bam files was done using NGSCheckMate tool (version 1.0.0) (Lee et al., 2017). Germline snps in protein-coding regions was used as a variant reference panel to allow simultaneous fingerprinting of WGS and exome libraries. NGSCheckMate does sample pairing QC based on shared germline variants found in samples (tumor and normal tissue from the same patient) and also model difference between samples (or libraries) based on sequencing depth-dependent variation in allelic fraction of reference variants.

For each merged/reduced segment, the proportion of the chromosome arm it spans was calculated.

Since accuracy of inferred subclonal structure depends largely on sequencing read depth and number of somatic variants per inferred subclone, we limited estimation of subclonal structure for maximum five subclones per patient given a minimum sequencing read depth of 30X for whole genome data we had across all three cohorts. Shannon entropy was then calculated using entropy function in the R package: entropy 1 by taking number of somatic variants per subclone per patient as a vector. A resulting Shannon entropy value was used to plot figures along with cancer cell fraction and number of clones derived per patient.

De-novo signatures \u00b6 First, de-novo signatures (Figure 3B) were constructed for canine (n=81), human pediatric (n=53) and adult cohort (n=23) using somatic snvs from whole-genome data. Signatures were constructed using non-negative matrix factorization (nmf R package, version 0.21.0) with brunet approach and 100 iterations with expected range of signatures between 2 to 10. Optimal signatures were then selected using nmfEstimateRank function to match number of de-novo signatures (clusters) \u2013 1 where inflection point for cophenetic correlation coefficient was observed. Accordingly, three de-novo signatures were found in canine and human pediatric gliomas while five in adult glioblastoma cohort. Known human signatures \u00b6 In the second part, known human mutational signatures from COSMIC (v2, n=30) and published pediatric cancer signature from two studies, T1 to T11 (Mansour et al., 2018) and P1 (Gr\u00f6bner et al., 2018) were pooled together and used to deconvolute (MutationalPattern R package, version 1.6.2) mutational trinucleotide context (n=96) from somatic snvs in each of three cohorts. Somatic ultra-hypermutation cases from pediatric (n=3) and adult cohort (n=1) were excluded from signature analysis. Cosine similarities of known signatures with de-novo signatures was then calculated and clustered using hierarchical clustering (Figure 3B). Absolute and relative contribution of known signatures per sample was then quantified using fit_to_signatures function which finds the linear combination of signatures that closely resembles 96 context based mutational matrix by solving the nonnegative least-squares constraints problem. We then selected top contributing signatures per cohort based on signatures which contributed per sample to higher than 3 rd quartile of median value of each signature\u2019s contribution (rowMedian) per cohort (Figure S3A). Top contributing signatures were further calculated using outlier profling on canine patients showing highest mutational load (>3 rd quartile of median coding mutation rate per megabase) and plotted in Figure 3A. Outlier sample detection was done using car::outlierTest function in R to label true outliers from entire cohort (2 cases) while correcting for confounding effects due to type of tissue archival (snap-frozen vs ffpe) and analysis type (tumor-matched normal versus tumor-only somatic variant calling). This was followed by second run of outlier by first excluding true outliers (2 cases), and then labelling outliers (six cases) based on chi-squared statistics using outliers::scores function in R. Signatures contributing to driver mutations (Figure 3C) were calculated based on first getting relative proportion of trinucleotide context per snv and then finding known signatures with maximum value for the same trinucleotide context. Known signatures were combined to a single group where they are shown in literature as potential underlying process, e.g., aging group is associated with COSMIC signature 1 and 5, and show significant cosine similarity (> 0.9) with pediatric signatures T1 and T4, respectively.

CCF per somatic snv was a product of variant allelic fraction (VAF) of a somatic snv, adjusted by local copy number of gene locus and whole tumor sample (ploidy) as well as purity estimate (tumor cell content) inferred from TitanCNA algorithm (Detailed under copy number estimation section above). A clonal (early) vs subclonal (late) mutation was then classified based on upper boundary of CCF was above 0.95 (clonal) or not (subclonal). Second, we timed copy number gain and copy-neutral LOH regions based on VAF of somatic snvs in these copy regions, i.e., early mutations prior to copy gain will have higher VAF relative to VAF of late mutations after copy gain. Third, we ordered mutations in four sequential categories: early clonal, early subclonal, late clonal, and late subclonal. We note here that early subclonal and late clonal categories are result of underlying parallel and/or convergent evolution of multiple clones (Venkatesan and Swanton, 2016) and/or a technical limitation (given ~60X depth of merged bam files and lack of spatial sequencing data) in resolving polyclonal structure of a tumor sample (Deshwar et al., 2015). We then tally frequency of each of these four categories per somatic driver mutation and get the average frequency of each category per driver mutation at cohort (canine, pediatric, adult) level. These average frequencies are converted to winning tables, similar to sports statistics where each driver mutation competes with remaining driver mutations with winning being an early somatic event based on order of events using clonality (Jolly and Van Loo, 2018) (step 3). Finally, a winning table is then passed to Bradley-Terry model ( BradleyTerryScalable R package, version 0.1.0.9000; https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BradleyTerryScalable/vignettes/BradleyTerryScalable.html ) to estimate winning probability (driver event being an early event) based on a Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate. Resulting winning probability per driver mutation is subtracted from 1 to plot multiple density plots (ggridges R package, version: 0.5.1.9000) with X-axis now showing a probability of event being a late event (Figure 3D). We note that density plots are based on kernel density estimates and thus, may extend their tails (probability distribution) beyond 1 or less than zero ( https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/histograms-density-plots.html ).","title":"Molecular Timing of Somatic Drivers"},{"location":"methods/S15_class_predict_methy/","text":"To compare the methylation patterns of human and canine glioma, the LIBLINEAR library was used to fit an L2-regularized logistic regression classifier. Model training and validation was performed on the human glioma samples and normal controls in the GSE109381 dataset (Capper et al., 2018), with the methylation status of CpGs located in regions of the human genome orthologous to canine CpG islands used to predict DNA methylation-based subtypes of glioma. The methylation categories designated as regression outcome variables were derived from the World Health Organization classification of gliomas: IDH-wildtype adult glioma, IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-intact adult glioma, IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-codeleted adult glioma, adult normal control, pediatric glioma, and pediatric normal control. After model fitting, the logistic regression classifier was applied to the canine samples, using the \uf062-values of CpGs orthologous to the selected 11,495 Illumina 450K probes as input data. For classifier CpG sites in the canine samples with no methylation observations, $\\beta$-values were predicted using the DNA module of the DeepCpG algorithm, a deep learning algorithm that predicts methylation state based on local DNA sequence context (Angermueller et al., 2017). The logistic regression classifier outputs the probability that a sample matches a given methylation category. Category probabilities were calculated for the canine samples, and these probabilities were compared with sample age, anatomical location, tumor grade, tumor purity, and mutation rate (Figure 4).","title":"Class Prediction using methylation classifier"},{"location":"methods/S16_expression_immune/","text":"Immunohistochemistry \u00b6 Hematoxylin & Eosin staining was used to classify glioma grade and lineage. The immunohistochemistry panel included those antibodies that have been documented to work in canine tissues and include myeloid microglia/macrophages (IBA1), monocytes (CD14) and their M2 skew subtype (CD163), and lymphoid T cells (CD3) and B cells (CD79a). Slides with 5um sections, were deparaffinized and rehydrated in a dry incubator (60\u00b0C for 1 hour), xylene, and histological grade ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer and a pressure cooker at 120\u00b0C23 for 12 minutes. Quenching for endogenous peroxidase was performed with 3% H2O2 for 15 minutes at room temperature. Non-specific binding was minimized using ready-to-use protein blocker (Dako) applied for 15 minutes before the application of the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. All the washing was done using 1x T-PBS buffer mixed with 0.1% Tween 20. The biotinylated secondary antibody was applied for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by three washes with buffer for 5 minutes each. Color development was performed using the DAKO DAB kit and color change was monitored until an appropriate detectable level was achieved (10-60 sec depending on the antibody). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin (25 seconds) and bluing buffer, then rehydrated and cover-slipped with long lasting mounting solution. The immunohistochemistry quantification were done blindly relative to the tumor pathology. Scanning and tissue segmentation \u00b6 Scanning and analysis were performed using the PerkinElmer Vectra Automated Quantitative Pathology Imaging System and the inForm Cell Analysis software (ver 2.4). Slides were scanned twice on low- and high-power fields as follows: the first scan was of the whole slide on low power field (10x) for manual tissue segmentation to identify three tumor regions/categories as necrotic center, tumor and invasive edge under the neuropathologist\u2019s supervision/direction. For each region, every fourth field was imaged (25%) on high-power field (20x) and resulted in 21 to 274 fields per slide, which varies according to the size of the tissue and presence or absence of necrosis. For the training set, heterogeneous fields were randomly selected to include tissue, non-tissue and damaged areas. Hematoxylin and DAB was used to identify the nuclei. Positive and negative cells were distinguished visually and three optical densities (OD) thresholds were set accordingly. The thresholds allowed 4-bin (0 = negative, +1 = weak positive, +2 = intermediate, +3 = strong positive) sorting of cells depending on the positivity and its intensity. The intermediate positivity threshold was calculated as the midpoint after setting the lower and higher threshold. The algorithm of the training set was applied for all the high-power fields captured. The results were inspected and the nonspecific and defective fields were removed before compiling the dataset.
